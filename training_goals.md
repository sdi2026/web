## Flutter Training 2026

Starting Feb. 2026, I plan to offer a Flutter training for students at TH Aschaffenburg.

At the end of the training, the students should be able to

- install and use a Flutter development environment with VS Code on their machines
- create a Hello World app and display texts and images therein
- use buttons, switches, sliders and other UI elements to interact with the user
- write own components in Dart and corresponding automated tests
- measure the line coverage of these tests
- explain what is meant with "sound null safety" in Dart
- use asynchronous programming in Dart e.g. to read data from a Web API
- create dynamic effects in the UI by using timers
- react on user gestures like panning
- show or hide UI elements after user interaction
- use external packages e.g. to display gauges and charts in a flutter app
- visualize zoomable maps in an app and display geographic info like rain radar therein
- change the display language of a Flutter app e.g. from English to German
- build apk or app bundle files to install Flutter apps on Android devices
- publish Flutter apps via GitHub pages as Web apps

During the training I plan to develop the following apps and share their code on GitHub:<br>
- [flying_balls](https://fdg2425.github.io/web/flying_balls/) (timer, gesture detection, show/hide UI elements)
- [lux_meter](https://fdg2425.github.io/web/fdg_lux_meter/)  (use external packages, switch light & dark theme, use front camera in Android)
- [open_meteo_ui](https://guentherschmitt.github.io/web_test/open_meteo_ui/) (get weather forecast from Web API, show zoomable maps, change display language)

Short info about the trainer:

My name is Günther Schmitt, I worked nearly 40 years as software engineer, the last 20 years at Schneider Electric developing Windows apps with C++ and C#. After my retirement in 2021 I wanted to learn writing code for Android. First I used .Net and Microsoft MAUI, but then I came across Flutter and enjoyed working with it. Since 2023 I offer Flutter trainings for young students to share my knowledge and my fun in coding.
